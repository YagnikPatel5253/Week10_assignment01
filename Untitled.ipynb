    "Multithreading in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is a programming concept where multiple threads (small units of a process) run concurrently within a single process. Each thread represents a separate flow of control, and they share the same resources such as memory space but run independently. In Python, the threading module is commonly used to implement multithreading.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Multithreading is Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency: Multithreading allows multiple threads to execute simultaneously, improving the overall concurrency of a program. This is especially useful for tasks that can be performed independently and don't necessarily need to be executed sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsive User Interfaces: In graphical user interface (GUI) applications, multithreading can be used to keep the user interface responsive while performing background tasks. This prevents the user interface from freezing during resource-intensive operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism: Although Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks, multithreading can still be beneficial for I/O-bound tasks, where threads can perform I/O operations concurrently without being hindered by the GIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Sharing: Threads within the same process share the same memory space, making it easy to share data and resources between them. This can simplify communication between different parts of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Module for Handling Threads in Python:\n",
    "The 'threading' module is used."
